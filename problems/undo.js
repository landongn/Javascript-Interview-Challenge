 * In order to atomically change those properties, 
 * we'll need to make a series of commands that perform an action.  
 *
 * Your object should be able to go back to any action and ensure that 
 * depending on the index on the stack you point to, all the commands added
 * up to that point have been executed.

// good luck!
